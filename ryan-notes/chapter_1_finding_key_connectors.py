# Exercise 1
# Create a dict where the keys are user ids and the values are lists of friend ids. 
# Output:
# {
#   0: [1, 2],
#   1: [0, 2, 3],
#   2: [0, 1, 3],
#   etc...

# Determine the total number of connections:

# Degree Centrality
# A simple count of the total number of connections linked to a vertex
# The degree centrality of a node is simply its degreeâ€”the number of edges it has. 

# create a list of tuples that have (user_id, number_of_friends)

# sort by most friends to least friends

# Each pair is (user_id, number_of_friends)

# What we've done in the above operation is compute the network metric of "degree centrality"
